# todoApp
For this project i have built a to-do-list application from scratch. It consists of 3 layers:
- front end(pure javascript with little bit of bootstrap)
- back end(spring boot+spring data)
- datbase (mysql)


This is the front page of the application:

When the document is ready the days that consist any task are loaded from the database.
By clicking on particular day app performs a call to the backend to retrieve tasks for this particular day from database.

User can manage his tasks by adding, editing or deleting.
